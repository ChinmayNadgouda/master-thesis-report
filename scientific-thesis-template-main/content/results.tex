After implementing our system, experimentations are the next step to evaluate the system. We will focus on quantitative and qualitative results.
To present our quantitative results we will use Average Precision at mIoU thresholds 25\% and 50\% and for qualitative results will present few of 
the point cloud segmentations and scene graphs generated using our system. 

For experimentations, we have used ARKIT scenes dataset. They provide large number of scenes enumerated by visit_id and each visit_id has atmost three 
video recordings of the same scene denoted by video_id. For the purpose of experiments we divide the dataset into train, validation and test splits. We have trained
the Mask3D and PointNet models with training set and validation set. Therefore, for experimentation we will use the test split and evaluate the two SceneFun3D tasks defined 
earlier.

\subsection{Functionality segmentation:}
For this task we will present both the quantitative results as well as the qualitative results. The results from scenefun3d for this task are taken as baseline. 
SceneFun3D have used adpated versions of Mask3D and SoftGroup and LERF for experiments. We have utilised Mask3D and PointNet ++ in our experiments. The reason for using 
Mask3D was to compare the results with scenefun3d and evaluate our method. PointNet ++ was leverage as it is the state of the art 3D CNN for part segmentation.

The table below compare the resutls from scenefun3d and our implementation results. We also consider all the results from scenefun3d and not only limit ourselves to
Mask3D. Additionally, we also include our point net ++ results.

In addition to quantitative results, let us take a look at some qualitative results in Figure above. We compare our results with the ground truth.

\subsection{Task-driven affordance grounding:}
The results for this task will be presented as quantitative results with images from the output of our system. We query our concept graph with natural language
queries and the system returns us the segmented point cloud with the most probable object highlighted in red, the second most probable obejct in a orangish red shade and 
thus .

We ask our system two queries, "Open the cabinet below the mirror" and "Open the drawer of the cabinet next to the bathtub." 
The results of the two queries are given below.
